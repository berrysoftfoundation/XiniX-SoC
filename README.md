# XiniX SoC – A Complete, Open‑Source, Heterogeneous RISC‑V System‑on‑Chip

## What is XiniX SoC

XiniX is a production‑ready, fully synthesizable RISC‑V SoC designed within the Chipyard framework. It integrates a powerful heterogeneous CPU complex, dedicated AI/ML accelerators, high‑speed I/O, multimedia engines, advanced security features, and comprehensive power management – all in a single, coherent design.

The project follows a layered PHY‑Core‑Frontend architecture, includes conditional instantiation for external dependencies, built‑in self‑test (BIST) for every module, and a presence register at offset 0xFFC for seamless software discovery. All modules are licensed under the BSD‑3‑Clause license, making XiniX a truly open foundation for next‑generation computing.
